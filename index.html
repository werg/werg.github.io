<p>This is the only way I know how to viably start a third party in the United States: <em>Steal votes from both sides.</em></p>
<p><em>There are shared economic interests between working and salary class people on either side of the current political divide. We can form a unified voting block around issues such as healthcare and immigration, if we set aside gridlock on cultural issues. I'll explain how.</em></p>
<h3>The do-nothing divide</h3>
<p>American politics is divided into two distinct cultural blocks; One is more urban, the other rural, one more secular, the other church-going, bi-coastal vs flyover, etc.. We are of course talking about Democrats and Republicans. These two parties control electoral politics in the United States, without serious competition.</p>
<p>The majority of us have very little influence on what actually gets done in Washington. This is the elite strategy of divide-and-conquer: Most states are basically "owned" by one faction, so the political elite can largely get away with paying lip-service to their constituents, paint a scary picture of the other side and then proceed to change precious little in favor of their voters. Either because it's hard to do so, or they don't care, or both.</p>
<p>The big drawback with splitting our political factions on cultural lines is that it focuses the entire debate on topics that the government sucks at: It is very hard, as a government, to do anything about getting people to go to church. It may well be possible to promote certain talking points of church leaders, but the government can't turn hearts. Religion is a matter of civil society and moral education. It is very hard, as a government, to keep people from being bigoted and racist. We have been able to clamp down on certain limited, provable forms of discrimination, but the cultural project of tolerance and respect has been much more important and impactful on that front.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if we concede that politics does have an impact on public customs and morals, we must insist that this influence is slow-acting and goes both ways. Observe the movement to establish public acceptance of homosexuality: It clothed itself in the garb of a political movement for marriage equality and succeeded as such. However, this success was much more far reaching than just the political and legal sphere and its success didn't by accident coincide with the exact stage at which a vocal <em>conservative</em> gay population was gaining visibility; For all the factionalism in politics, culture is by definition a consensus-driven and consensus-seeking process.</p>
<p>Instead of changing culture, the government is best at making budgets, setting taxes, conducting foreign policy, negotiating trade deals, administering the military, creating social support programs and business stimulus. Interestingly, these are <em>exactly the areas</em> in which there is the strongest bipartisan consensus in Washington and the least political differentiation because <strong>these are the interests of the elites</strong>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the above are topics of shared non-elite interest as well, which cut across cultural and geographic boundaries, <em>in joint opposition to the Washington consensus</em>. In fact, there are more differences of interest within Democratic and Republican voter blocks, between lower and upper classes, than there are between Democrats and Republicans of the same economic class.</p>
<h3>The target demographic</h3>
<p>Just to recap: our political discourse and our electoral contests are divided over topics that politics can't do very much about, while neglecting exactly <em>the</em> policy areas where <em>our government is very powerful and can do a lot</em>. Unsurprisingly, all this plays into the hand of the upper classes and the elite. It is a sad reality. However, there is some good news if we look at the demographic data:</p>
<p><img alt="Income demographics" src="images/personal_income_pointout.png"></p>
<p>According to the US Census, households making 100k/year or less make up 85% of the population and 60% of all registered voters.
If we target all voters with an <em>individual</em> income of less than 100k (not households), this number is even greater. 
US demographics make a decent case for populism, especially if there is at least some success in expanding the electorate. The most recent difficulties of the Sanders campaign to do just that notwithstanding.</p>
<h3>How the election will play out</h3>
<p>Donald Trump first got elected with the help of rust-belt country responding to an economic agenda which was anathema to the bipartisan elite consensus: Get out of international free trade deals, reinvest in domestic manufacturing, stop sending working class youth to be killed and traumatized in foreign imperial wars and do something about illegal immigration undercutting working-class wages. At this point President Trump has a mediocre to abysmal record on actually implementing these promises. Until recently he had been buoyed by a favorable economic climate, which now has gone into free fall. Most importantly he has been incompetent at infrastructure investments and all over the map on reigning in imperial wars (perhaps less evil than his predecessors, but also much less coherent). He has ineffectually fumbled his way through re-negotiating trade deals and building his border wall, which does not actually address the labor market problem of immigration. Trump lowered taxes on the wealthy and failed to salvage Obamacare, instead letting it slide even further.</p>
<p>Where we stand right now, Bernie Sanders is the only presidential candidate with a platform that is plausibly in working people's economic interest. Unfortunately his hopes at gaining the nomination of the Democratic party have dimmed considerably. If he does not get nominated Donald Trump will win, unless his support gets suppressed by a bungled Coronavirus response -- or he himself dies of the disease. If Donald Trump gets re-elected he will be unleashed in his own craven self-interest. -- It's honestly hard to say where that would lead, other than all over the place.</p>
<p>When Trump leaves office there will be an attempt by the elites to return the Republican party to its Washington consensus roots. Even if these efforts are inconclusive, the populist wing of the party has struggled to spread its message beyond whites and remains stuck with a kind of white identity politics. This problem is of course flipped in the populist parts of the Democratic party, which is even more out of touch with working people's interests.</p>
<p><img alt="I'm Joe Biden and I forgot this message" src="images/biden_forgot-min.jpeg"></p>
<h3>A party with an actual program</h3>
<p>Throughout recent American political history it has been nigh impossible to launch a third party. Starting anything new is difficult, particularly a political movement. Moreover, most attempts at forming new parties have shot themselves in the foot by positioning their platform at the more radical fringe of one of the two big cultural blocks. As such they naturally ran the risk of "spoiler" accusations, like Ralph Nader of the Green Party, who plausibly cost Al Gore the presidency in the 2000 presidential election.</p>
<p>This is why it will be essential to loudly and publicly steal votes from both sides. The two core positions should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Universal public healthcare: Simply pick up the Sanders plan.</li>
<li>Effectively ending illegal immigration: It disproportionally undermines working class wages and is contributing to cultural displacement in rural areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>To end illegal immigration I have a proposal that should be palatable to all sides while accentuating the common class interest of the majority of Americans: We should introduce an amnesty by law (not executive order!) which requires applicants to report all their employers in order to gain legal status. The law would introduce mandatory minimum prison sentences for employers who hire illegals going forward and create a Federal Labor Offenders Registry for individuals and corporations. Furthermore I would include provisions for mandatory minimum seizure of ownership in corporations that employ illegal aliens.</p>
<p>Incidentally, seizure of ownership stakes would be a great addition to our corporate penal system. Percentages should be commensurate to the portion of an average lifetime that incarceration would take from an individual. </p>
<p>Further core topics could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring our troops back home and end forever wars: An entirely uncontroversial position for almost everybody in the US except the "people who matter".</li>
<li>Industrial policy instead of globalization: Incentivize domestic production and don't give federal contracts to off-shoring companies</li>
<li>A broad infrastructure-investment program: rebuild roads, trains, green energy, plant trees.</li>
<li>Strengthen families: Two year family leave, to be shared by parents and a young family home ownership program.</li>
<li>Restructuring of all student debt.</li>
<li>Free public colleges.</li>
<li>End at-will employment. In a downturn I'd much rather bail out companies who employ people than banks.</li>
<li>$15 minimum wage with automatic inflation adjustment.</li>
<li>Ground the government by moving federal administration centers to "flyover states".</li>
<li>A federal job guarantee. Work is a matter of human dignity.</li>
<li>Support for unions. End "right-to-work legislation".</li>
<li>Prosecute bankers and reinstate Glass-Steagall.</li>
</ul>
<p>In reality land these topics are absolute no-brainers. </p>
<h3>Setting aside the differences</h3>
<p>We need to cultivate a shared goal to set aside the the cultural differences within the American working electorate. I would propose leading with the argument I lay out above: Cultural issues make ineffectual political issues. When pressed, this program could be backed up by a series of simple compromise positions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guns: Let gun owners have their guns, and support regulated militias as stipulated by the 2nd Amendment. States get to regulate details.</li>
<li>Abortion: Nobody sane wants to go back to coat-hangers and sepsis. Lead with a pro-life message of promising to completely eliminate any abortions for economic reasons. Strengthen families with financial support, health-care and generous family leave.</li>
<li>Racism and other forms of discrimination: It's the law of the land to enforce an end to discrimination, particularly when doling out federal investment.</li>
<li>Religious freedom. Make a more differentiated case against discrimination than forcing bakers to make cakes for weddings that they don't care for.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Epic handshake between The New Right and Socialists" src="images/epic_handshake.png"></p>
<h3>How to start</h3>
<p>I had hoped that a brokered convention in the Democratic party nomination would be a good catalyst for starting such a party. This scenario looks less likely by the minute, but we shall see. Joe Biden, the presumptive nominee is clearly suffering from dementia or some other form of mental deterioration. There currently is a deadly disease passing through the land which disproportionally affects the elderly, with all three, Biden, Trump and Sanders falling into that category. We may well end up with a Pence presidency. Things are in flux.</p>
<p>A new, populist party of course cannot count on the establishment media to fairly cover its message. In order to spread the news I see several non-exclusive methods:</p>
<p><img alt="going cabbage" src="images/cabbage.gif"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Outrage and earned media</strong> (the Trump technique): Talk about stuff that the establishment may find really controversial, but most people don't really care about. Even more importantly: Viciously attack the elite. Fight. Go after their weaknesses, go after their strengths. Do this in full knowledge that they will do the same to you anyway.</li>
<li>
<strong>Ignore the media, seek out neglected groups</strong>, work hand-in-glove with a charitable wing / parallel organization to basically replace social services. Help organize unions, fight for childcare, build churches. This is an approach popularized by insurgent groups such as Hezbollah or Sinn Fein. I am not sure whether this strategy will work if you don't have one single oppressed cultural identity to associate with. But a modified approach might work. God knows there are a lot of neglected communities in the US.</li>
<li>
<strong>Usurping primaries</strong>: What's to stop a party from running two endorsed candidates in each of the big party primaries at the same time. As long as they clearly tout their loyalty to the populist cause</li>
</ul>
<h3>My perspective</h3>
<p>I write this as someone who culturally stands closer to the people who generally vote for the Democratic party. I purposely circumscribe this because I'm loathe to call myself a liberal and I don't fundamentally believe in "progress" (that's a topic for another discussion). I am sympathetic to socialist positions, specifically if they are centered around democratic worker cooperatives within a market.</p>
<p>From this perspective, I have been doing my best to consider what the most salient concerns would be for people who'd be called populist conservatives and to cater to their needs. Perhaps over-reaching, perhaps neglecting aspects that matter. If you identify as such I would be very curious to hear your perspective.</p>
<p>I am particularly curious about one thing: Do you agree that Trump, while having his moments and sticking it to <em>some</em> elites, is largely incompetent and ineffective? Do you see yourself represented by the Republican party? What are your main gripes? This is really about making a case that is appealing to both sides of the coin.</p>
<p>Whether you're a habitual Republican or Democrat voter, one thing is clear: Supporting a joint populist party is the strongest way for you to advance your interests and the well-being of your loved ones. Either it puts pressure on the establishment to take your needs into account, or populism wins -- or both! </p>

<p>As a Data Scientist you usually do one of two things:
1. You comb through a pile of numbers derived from a SQL database, S3 or an HDFS cluster, in order to answer questions like "what keeps customers from converting?" and make predictions like "How much is a given user worth?".
2. You build Machine Learning models that do actual ongoing work in deployed applications.</p>
<p>For both of these task groups there exists a different job title with similar job description:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you replace the SQL with Excel spreadsheets, then Analysts have been and still are answering the same kind of questions.</li>
<li>Software Engineers have been doing Machine Learning for a long time. Long enough that there now is such a thing as a Machine Learning Engineer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Data Scientists distinguish themselves from Analysts by knowing a bit more about programming. They distinguish themselves from Software Engineers by knowing less about programming. They differ from both in that Data Scientists usually are expected to have gone to grad school and know a thing or two more about math. </p>
<p>The "Data Scientist" job title was a way for industry to hire academics to do the kind of computational modeling that PhD candidates usually do in academia.
Also, it was a way for managers to feel cool, hip and with it.</p>
<p><strong>But it's dying.</strong></p>
<p>Why you say? Well, I'm glad you asked:</p>
<ol>
<li>Analysts can and do learn how to write SQL queries. Often (not always) the math involved in answering business questions can actually be kept relatively simple, you often don't need a PhD to do it. Doesn't hurt though, I guess.</li>
<li>Machine learning is getting commodified. You no longer need to write your own backpropagation algorithm in order to do Deep Learning. (It's sad, I know.) All you need is GPUs and money to burn. -- Well, and feature engineering, you do need feature engineering from time to time. And some experience in the field and domain knowledge. But all those can be acquired by many a bright individual.
Also, if your models are to do real work, they usually need to be integrated into real code. Here it comes in handy to know a thing or two about Software Engineering. Hence the rise in popularity of the ML Engineer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now I know for a fact that once you give a group of people in the professional class a title and a decent salary, they'll make sure their field will continue to be needed, come hell or high water. So, in fact: <em>I lied.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sorry.</strong></p>
<p>Data Science is going nowhere, it's just that if you happen to not have Data Scientists on hand at your organization, <em>don't fret, you still can get stuff done.</em></p>
<p>But if you decide you do desperately need someone to make sweet, sweet Science to your Data; I'm a Sciencer of Data myself, possibly accepting clients. -- Or maybe I'm an ML Engineer, or something like that... Just give me a ring.</p>

<p>Many (maybe most) of us Software Engineers are deeply involved in projects where UI and UX are very important concerns (or at least they should be). Throughout the short history of our profession, we have become more and more focused on understanding and serving the people who will actually be subjected to the stuff we build:  <strong>users</strong>. In many cases, this focus on UI/UX isn't because we particularly enjoy worrying about such matters -- no, it's simply because we have to if we want to build successful products!</p>
<p>There has been tremendous growth in the field of UX/UI. Without a doubt, today's applications are much more user-friendly than those from 30 years ago. Back then, users were given  <strong>features</strong>, interface be damned. It was only over time that customers came to appreciate, expect, demand and reward those applications that actually cared to consider their needs.
<em>Consumer demand drove UX as a discipline</em>.</p>
<p>This process has been fast in some areas, slow in others. Nowhere has it been slower than in the realm of programming tools. We coders still put up with horrid UX/UI when programming.</p>
<p><img alt="Visual Studio" src="images/visual_studio.png" title="User Experiance"></p>
<h2>Why DX lags behind</h2>
<p>In my view the User Interface of programming encompasses a lot, from the type system of the programming language that you use, its error messages, to the editor you're writing code in, the websites you go to in order to get help, all the way to the cloud hosting systems you deploy on. Developer Interface / Developer Experience is comprised of all of this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Counter to any UI/UX philosophy, as programmers we find ourselves maintaining vast background knowledge about the structure and dynamics of our programs, with nary a visual cue to help us.</li>
<li>It's often so hard to figure out what <em>exactly</em> went wrong when something goes wrong.</li>
<li>A lot of tools are truly ugly!</li>
</ul>
<p>When was the last time you heard of a programming language discussed in terms of discoverability, succinctness, relevance, let alone beauty?</p>
<p>I believe there are two reasons for the discrepancy between general UX and DX:</p>
<p><img alt="ENIAC Computers" src="images/eniac1.jpg" title="The good old days"></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Coding tools were around before UI/UX was a thing</strong>.
We've simply gotten used to them: Dealing with the idiosyncracies of bash, vi, or the JavaScript type system have become a part of the professional hazing process.
They may be suboptimal, <em>but they're ours!</em>
This is compounded by the fact that the history of technology is so path dependent. In so many cases it is much easier and more profitable to build on something existing rather than reinvent the wheel. -- Even if the existing wheel is full of arbitrary decisions and in fact impediments to what you are trying to do. Just look at the long reign of the x86 architecture, or consider the fact that basically all Operating Systems these days follow the Unix architecture. The fact that JavaScript is what it is. -- I don't mean to say that these technologies are without merit, however they also have considerable flaws and it has been more efficient to work with and around than to replace them entirely.
Certainly every mature technology will have to deal with technical debt in the inner workings of its guts. I have no bones with that. However, if the gory details are in the guts, then we coders are the GI surgeons having to deal with them. -- And we need sharper scalpels, better imaging and protective gear. In short: better tools.
<img alt="Chomsky Hierarchy" src="images/chomsky_hierarchy.png" title="Theoretical CS was fun">
</li>
<li>
<strong>Fundamentally, programming is a Turing Complete business.</strong>
You can view a UI as a form of (visual) formal language. For most GUIs the language complexity, the different states that the application interface can find itself in, would largely correspond to regular languages (some may be context-free, but that's pushing it). The visual languages are "flat", predictable, without feedback loops or long distance dependencies. It is in such an environment that UI/UX principles have been able to thrive.
But what did our <em>Intro to Theoretical CS</em> course teach us in college? You can't assume that statements about regular languages will still hold for Linearly Bounded Automata, let alone Turing Machines.
Fundamental principles in conventional UI/UX design no longer apply when it comes to programming. DI/DX is a very, very special case UI/UX.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, what I believe has happened is that in many cases we programmers have tilted at windmills of trying to improve our tooling -- the eternal yak shave -- only to be thwarted by the complexity of our own work, inevitably giving up and going with the most rudimentary system capable of doing the job somehow, even if it sucks.</p>
<h2>Toward better DX</h2>
<p><img alt="Ironman interface" src="images/futuristic_interface.jpeg" title="This could be us but you coding"></p>
<p>So, what's the alternative? Here are my suggestions for a world with better Developer Experience:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<em>Watch what coders actually do</em> -- this is one principle from UX that applies readily. Library developers rarely know what error messages users most commonly get stuck on; How about user studies? We track every click that people make on our website and agonize over button sizes, but know precious little about how common which call paths in our framework are. The elephant in the room here of course is privacy.</li>
<li>
<em>Address the many components that make up programming in concert</em>: Editor, shell, repl, language, version control host, cloud host and framework. Generally these pieces are not very aware of each other. There is some movement on this front: Microsoft is gearing up to tightly integrate VSCode, GitHub and Azure. This portends market domination. Competitors take note!</li>
<li>
<em>Search</em> -- It's our dirty little secret how much programming nowadays depends on Google. Arguable it is the most important item in our toolbelt. However, search engines nowadays do a uniquely poor job supporting developers. Most of recent Natural Language Understanding developments have made search less precise and less useful for coders, while hardly any new features have been added with our needs in mind. I find this topic fascinating and I'll be writing more about it-- coming up!</li>
<li>
<em>Standardize fundamental questions</em> -- How do I run this thing? Where does the code start? Is my system configured correctly? Project Readmes are hardly ever up to date. Why do we treat this as a moral failing instead of a usability issue?</li>
<li>
<em>Tests are a usability dead end</em>  -- I know this may be contentious, but I believe test suites are another realm of excessive moralizing en lieu of better tools and better processes. Too often they function as a security blanket that simply encases the parts of the code that are <em>unit testable</em>, while leaving the vulnerable, untestable bits fluttering in the wind. Approaches such as generative testing seem more promising.</li>
<li>
<em>Intelligently hide details</em> -- Writing code is about control, however understanding code is not. Most environments throw up their hands and overwhelm you with the entire pile of everything the program does, in minute detail. Others take a different tack and try to hide the bitter realities behind magic -- impenetrable and beautiful until you inevitably <em>do</em> have to care about what's behind the curtain. Why do we have so few systems that would allow us to zoom in and out? <em>Get you a coding environment that can do both</em>.</li>
<li>
<em>Coding is a social process</em> -- The success of GitHub is a testament to this. I'm not sure, but maybe we can do even better along these lines.</li>
<li>
<em>Programming Languages are User Interfaces</em> -- The most fundamental unit of Developer Experience is the programming language. The Elm language is one of few examples where this reality was considered explicitly in the design process.</li>
<li>
<em>Programming is about empowering</em> -- dumbing things down is <em>not</em> enough. I believe minimalism is a cheap approach to UX in general, but it definitely doesn't work for DX -- it fundamentally misses the point of what programming is about: expressive power. I believe this is why many "graphical"/beginner programming languages have failed.</li>
<li>
<em>Engage with Theoretical Computer Science</em> -- In a way we are hunting for UI widgets (or other kinds of artifacts) that can faithfully represent the full computational complexity of algorithms. I have been actively working on this front and it's a long term project that you hopefully will be hearing more about. Representing computational complexity is also the one area where <a href="http://worrydream.com/">Bret Victor's</a> excellent work may have fallen short of what we ultimately need.</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="UX Meme" src="images/why-ux-research-is-important.png" title="Just ship it!"></p>
<h2>DX is worth it</h2>
<p>Interest in this topic is growing. It's definitely worth looking into. The software industry is so big and expensive that even small improvements can have considerable impact. Furthermore, Software Engineers actually <em>do</em>  respond to better UX -- and they wield considerable purchasing power. Consider the following example:</p>
<p>I once worked at a small company, which for regulatory reasons couldn't use the normal cloud-hosted GitHub. Our engineering department strong-armed the rest of the company to purchase on-premise GitHub Enterprise at a cost equivalent to hiring one or two additional engineers, <em>just so we could use Pull-Requests!</em> We recognized the difference it made in our productivity and we demanded it -- only the best of tools would do.</p>
