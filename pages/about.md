I'm a Software Engineer and Data Scientist by trade, currently mainly interested in building better programming languages and developer tools.

Another project of mine is to do without air travel in my life. I started out by cutting air trips within continental landmasses in favor of train and bus for several years. -- I got to travel across Siberia twice and I've criss-crossed Europe and the US by train multiple times. Most recently I've crossed the Atlantic by sail in order to cut flights out of my life entirely.
